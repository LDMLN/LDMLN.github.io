							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I started programming a bit after I moved to Japan in late 2019. I had passed the japanese language test that I had been aiming for and was looking for something else I could study while abroad.
								That's something about me, I love trying to learn new things. From (trying) to learn how to draw to Japanese to programming. It's extremely fulfilling for me to gain competency at a new skill. 
								Thankfully, coding is also a lot of fun.
							</p>
							<p>I've been doing it for a few years now and getting to the point where I can make the projects I want to make and solve the problems I want to solve has been extremely satisfying.
								I have had the chance to work with other programmers before and I had a blast seeing the work get partioned out as we slowly built up a project larger than what we could have reasonably done 
								on our own. That collaborative process was really interesting and I'm looking forward to my next chance to work on a team again. 
							</p>
							<p>
								As far as hobbies go, I love reading and swimming as well as playing games when time allows. I also really enjoy learning languages and currently speak 3 (although to my family's annoyance my 
								japanese is better than my portugues) and am hoping to keep learning more.
							</p>
							<p>Thank you for your time and have a good day. I hope I hear from you: <b>Email:</b><a href="mailto:luizdleao@gmail.com" target="_blank"> luizdleao@gmail.com</a></p>
